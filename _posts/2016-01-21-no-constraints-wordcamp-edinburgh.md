In November 2015 I gave a talk at [WordCamp Edinburgh](https://edinburgh.wordcamp.org/2015/) called *No constraints - building a minimum viable product with WordPress*. I told the story of how we used WordPress to build a vision of what the University of St Andrews' web presence might look like while I was working in the [Digital communications team](http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/).

The prototype site that we built lead to the development of a [major, multi-phase, multi-year project](http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2015/11/02/digital-prospectus-business-case/).
