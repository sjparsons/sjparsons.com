I've been reading [_Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations_](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19542983W/Accelerate_The_Science_of_Lean_Software_and_DevOps_Building_and_Scaling_High_Performing_Technology_O) by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim about implementing DevOps techniques and how doing so drives performance of teams. 

One of the chapters introduces Westrum typology – a way to categorize teams based on their culture directly tied to their results. Dr. Ron Westrum identifies 3 different types of organizational cultures categorized by how they process information: pathological, bureaucratic and generative. In his 2005 article _A Typology of Organisational Cultures_, Westrum describes them like this:

**Pathological** Power-oriented  
  - Low cooperation 
  - Messengers shot 
  - Responsibilities shirked
  - Bridging discouraged 
  - Failure leads to scapegoating 
  - Novelty crushed

**Bureaucratic** Rule-oriented
  - Modest cooperation 
  - Messengers neglected
  - Narrow responsibilities 
  - Bridging tolerated 
  - Failure leads to justice
  - Novelty leads to problems

**Generative** Performance-oriented
  - High cooperation
  - Messengers trained 
  - Risks are shared
  - Bridging encouraged 
  - Failure leads to inquiry
  - Novelty implemented

Westrum's research tied teams with generative cultures to better outcomes. The research presented in _Accelerate_ uses the same model and correlates technical teams possessing generative cultures to better performance. Interestingly, however, it's not just the research that indicates this. I think most us take a quick look at what makes a generative team and we realize that we'd like to be part of that type of culture. 

As a software engineering manager, I carry the responsibility for our team delivering results. Since I began in this role I set a direction for creating the sort of team that I would like to be a part of. Learning about Westrum generative teams is really helping me understand that goal better and articulate it – great ideas give language to latent ideas. However, even more interesting is learning that creating such a generative culture has a direct bearing on the type of results we see.

Interestingly, research that [Google conducted about highly effective teams](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/marketing-resources/content-marketing/five-dynamics-effective-team/) came up with a similar conclusion – that the following dynamics are present in highly effective teams: psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, impact. Most important, however was psychological safety.

> [Psychological safety] ... was the single most important dynamic in an effective team. Psychological safety is about risk-taking and being comfortable with vulnerability. People who don’t feel psychologically safe worry that taking risks will mean they’re seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative or disruptive. Psychological safety means feeling confident about admitting mistakes, asking questions, or offering new ideas.

Not only is aiming for a generative culture the right thing to do by my direct reports (hopefully they'll be happier and enjoy their work and lives more), it's the most responsible thing I could do. We can get more done together, achieve better results for the business, and enjoy it more by fostering a generative team culture. 

I still have a lot to learn about how to foster a generative culture, but I'm fascinated by the far-reaching impacts that are possible by creating an environment that allow others to thrive and information to flow quickly and easily. In the information age, this is what good leadership is all about.
