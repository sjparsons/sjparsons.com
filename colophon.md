This site was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The logo is set in [FF Unit Light](https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/unit) by Erik Spiekermann. I used Adobe Illustrator to save the logo as an SVG format and manually edited the resulting file for the web. Text and headings are set in [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) by Steve Matteson provided by [Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/). The four colors used are Red 600, Red 900, Brown 50 and Brown 100 from [Google material design](http://www.google.co.uk/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette).

I built the CSS using [inuitcss](http://inuitcss.com/) &mdash; an OOCSS, BEM, Sass framework by Harry Roberts. Since inuitcss does not have extensive documentation yet, I used the [source](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry.github.com) of Harryâ€™s site, [CSS Wizardry](http://csswizardry.com/), for insight into how to setup inuitcss. You can also see the inuitcss [Getting started](https://github.com/inuitcss/getting-started) repository for more information. Thanks, Harry!

Also, hat tip to Mig Reyes for [inspiration](http://mig.io/).
