I am a Senior Staff Software Engineer and Tech Lead at [PayPal Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) (opinions posted here are my own). I have more than 15 years of professional experience developing critical software applications and services for a variety of organizations in fintech, travel, higher education and government. My current team at PayPal is building [Payments Orchestration](https://www.paypal.com/us/enterprise/payment-orchestration). I have deep expertise across the stack with a focus on web services. Recently, my focus has been on using serverless technologies to increase our velocity and deliver across a range of mandates. I am passionate about leadership, developing potential and maximizing the effectiveness of teams. I'm hungry to keep growing and foster a culture of innovation and excellence.
