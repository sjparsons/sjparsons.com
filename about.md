I'm a software engineer and leader. Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) (part of [PayPal](https://paypal.com)) - opinions posted here are my own. I have over a decade of professional experience developing critical software applications and services for a variety of organizations in finance, travel, higher education and government. My focus is currently on frontend JavaScript frameworks &mdash; particularly using React and GraphQL &mdash; and I bring full stack experience and an understanding of agile project management.
