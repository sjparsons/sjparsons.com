I'm currently working for the Scottish Government as a front end developer in the [mygov.scot team](http://inside.mygov.scot/). Our team builds [mygov.scot](https://www.mygov.scot) which is a
single point of entry to answer citizen questions. We're also working on a
redesign of [gov.scot](http://www.gov.scot). We have a microservice
architecture built in a combination of Java and JavaScript. Primarily, I contribute to
our front-end code (CSS/JS/HTML), NodeJS components and also work on our AngularJS single-page
app content management system.

Previously, I worked as a web developer in the [Digital communications team](http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. The team is transforming how the University approaches the web and other digital mediums, and is committed to user-centered design, data-informed decisions and agile project management. At St Andrews, I created and maintained a [digital pattern library](http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2015/06/16/an-introduction-to-the-digital-pattern-library/); it is a vital element of our initiative to achieve a consistent look and feel across the University’s sites and applications. I was actively involved in both the design and strategy for our digital products. I also maintained a 150+ site WordPress installation.


## Background

I published my first website in 2001 before going to university. It was for an online distance learning program that my Dad was involved in. I set up a web server running linux and ran the website from an internet connection with a static IP address. From that little office, people round the world downloaded my website. And so began my story with the web.

After finishing school, I went on to [Bemidji State University](http://www.bemidjistate.edu) and studied design for a year and a half and then switched major to mathematics with a minor in computer science. I was attracted to mathematics by it’s requirement for rigorous and logical thinking. However, in choosing math, I didn't leave design behind; the connection between the pursuit of beauty and function in design and mathematics is much stronger than it may seem on the surface.

As a part of my undergraduate experience, I wrote a 20 page thesis on Reed-Solomon error codes. The field of coding theory goes all the way back to a computer scientist named [Claude Shannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon). Error codes are now ubiquitous; we use error codes every day to help ensure the integrity of information transmitted over noisy channels. A common example are CD’s which are encoded using Reed-Solomon codes so that even if they get a small scratch they can still be read by a CD player. The raw data the player reads may be wrong in parts, but there’s a little extra data added to help the player still get the original message.

I went on to study advanced mathematics in Budapest as a part of the [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](http://www.budapestsemesters.com/) program which was originally setup by a famous mathematician named Paul Erdös. Although I love abstract thought, I found that I am most energised when I can combine deep conceptual thinking with pragmatic problem-solving. This led me back to considering more applied areas of mathematics.

All through my undergraduate degree I worked as a student for the Bemidji State doing web development. On the job, I learned HTML standards, CSS layout, PHP, ASPX, JavaScript, how to design landing pages, write content, and build content management systems and web applications. By the time I graduated I had already been working full-time for the University and when I returned from Budapest, I eventually got a permanent position.

Working at the University was engaging. Our team was small: two developers, myself included. We were responsible for creating and maintaining all websites for the University, building web applications, and maintaining application configuration for the web servers. My role was both wide and deep. I continued to hone and develop my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while also picking up skills building numerous web applications and web services. I drove the initiative to build a new responsive homepage for the University. I also liaised with people across the entire institution, building relationships that were crucial to my personal development and the success of my work. Problem-solving and brainstorming became my everyday tools.

During my time at the University I also had several opportunities to teach *Introduction to Web Programming* and *Advanced Web Programming* in the Computer Science program -- 3rd year, 3000-level classes.

In 2014, I began work at the University of St Andrews in Scotland as a web developer. As a part of the Digital communications team I have been able to apply my significant experience in web development to help lead the technical aspects of the digital transformation we’re engaged in. My work involved liaising with web site and application developers across the University to understand and meet design needs of their applications. The work included a blend of technical expertise, design and people skills. I acquired agile project management methodologies and received training in both project management and business analysis.
