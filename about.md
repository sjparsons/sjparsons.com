I’m currently working as a web developer in the [Digital communications team](http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. We’re transforming how the University approaches the web and other digital mediums. We committed to user-centered design, data-driven decisions and agile project management. We’re passionate about meeting the demands of 21st century students and staff. At St Andrews, I created and now maintain a digital pattern library; it’s a vital element of our initiative to achieve a consistent look and feel across the University’s sites and applications. I am actively involved in both the design and strategy for digital products. I also maintain a 150+ site WordPress installation.

## Background

I found myself creating websites and applications quite early. I published my first website in 2001 before I graduated high school. It was for an online distance learning program that my Dad was involved in. I set up a web server running linux and ran the website from an internet connection with a static IP address at a nearby church. From that little office, people round the world downloaded my website. And so began my story with the web.

After finishing school, I went on to [Bemidji State University](http://www.bemidjistate.edu) and studied design for a year and a half and then switched major to mathematics with a minor in computer science. I was attracted to mathematics by it’s requirement for rigorous and logical thinking. Essentially, I chose math *because* it was hard. However, in studying math, I didn't leave design behind; rather, my early studies in design proved formative. I’ve been fascinated and delighted by beautiful and useful design ever since. The connection between the pursuit of beauty and function in design and mathematics is much stronger than it may seem on the surface.

As a part of my undergraduate experience, I wrote a 20 page thesis on Reed-Solomon error codes. The field of coding theory goes all the way back to a computer scientist named [Claude Shannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon). Error codes are now ubiquitous; we use error codes every day to help ensure the integrity of information transmitted over noisy channels. A common example are CD’s which are encoded using Reed-Solomon codes so that even if they get a small scratch they can still be read by a CD player. The raw data the player reads is wrong in parts, but there’s a little of extra data added to help the player still get the original message. 

I went on to study advanced mathematics in Budapest as a part of the [Budapest Semesters in Mathematics](http://www.budapestsemesters.com/) program which was originally setup by a famous mathematician named Paul Erdös. Although I love abstract thought, I found that I am most energised when I can combine deep conceptual thinking with pragmatic problem-solving. This led me back to considering more applied areas of mathematics.

All through my undergraduate degree I worked as a student for the Bemidji State doing web development. On the job, I learned HTML standards, CSS layout, PHP, ASPX, JavaScript, how to design landing pages, write content, and build content management systems and web applications. By the time I graduated I had already been working full-time for the University and when I returned from Budapest, I eventually got a permanent position. 

Working at the University was engaging. Our team was small: two developers, myself included. We were responsible for creating and maintaining all websites for the University, building web applications, and maintaining application configuration for the web servers. My role was both wide and deep. I continued to hone and develop my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while also picking up skills building numerous web applications and web services. I drove the initiative to build a new responsive homepage for the University. I also liaised with people across the entire institution, building relationships that were crucial to my personal development and the success of my work. Problem-solving and brainstorming became my everyday tools.

During my time at the University I also had several opportunities to teach 3000 level (Junior/3rd year) classes on web programming in the Computer Science program – classes that had not been available when I was a student, but for which I had developed significant experience on the job. Teaching a University class while working full-time is a challenging experience, but certainly rewarding. As they say, teaching is one of the best teachers, and the experience clarified my understanding of the technologies I use and has improved my craft.

In 2014, I began work at the University of St Andrews in Scotland as a web developer. Being originally from Scotland, I was interested in living here again with my family and the job at the St Andrews was a perfect fit. 

As a part of the Digital communications team I have been able to apply my significant experience in web development to help lead the technical aspects of the digital transformation we’re engaged in. I have created a digital pattern library now in use on the new University homepage. The work has involved liaising with web site and application developers across the University to understand and meet design needs of their applications. The work includes a blend of technical expertise, design and people skills. I have also grown in agile project management methodologies, receiving training in both project management and business analysis.

At the same time as beginning to work at St Andrews, I also began a masters program part-time at the University in [statistics and data mining](http://www.creem.st-and.ac.uk/datamining/). The masters program gives a grounding in statistics and the technical skills to use data to find information. I am fascinated by exploring the intersection of design, programming and data science; it’s a field rich with possibilities.
