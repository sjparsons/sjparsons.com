I'm a software engineer and leader. Currently, I'm a Development Manager at [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com). I have over a decade of professional experience developing critical software applications and services for a variety of organizations in travel, higher education and government. My focus is currently on frontend JavaScript frameworks &mdash; particularly using React and GraphQL &mdash; and I bring full stack experience and an understanding of agile project management.
